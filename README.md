# Metalloscribe-Clone

Code for MetalloScribe, a research project conducted at the Barzilay Lab to create a vision model that can identify the identity of organometallic complexes given images of their molecular structure.

Extends MolScribe, which can recognize general, 2D images of simple chemistry molecules. MetalloScribe extends it to 3D cases and for much more complicated organic molecules.
